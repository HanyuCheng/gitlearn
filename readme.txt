Hello,I'm Harry Cheng.Welcome to my first git repository.
Git is a version control system.
Git is free.I really love it!

Hi,I'm back.
Now I am learning chapter 2 of "learning git" wrote by MichaelLiao. I think he wrote a very good guidebook about git.

Hello,I'm back again,
Now I'm learning how to modify the files in repository.
This is my first try

creating a new branch called dev.
While master is used to formally update,dev is used to edit and revise.
