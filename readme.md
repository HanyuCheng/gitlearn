Hello,I'm Harry Cheng.Welcome to my first git repository.
Git is a version control system.
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.I really love it!

Second time texting this file.
Now I am learning chapter 2 of "learning git" wrote by MichaelLiao. I think he wrote a very good guidebook about git.

third time.
Now I'm learning how to modify the files in repository.
This is my first try.

creating a new branch called dev.
While master is used to formally update,dev is used to edit and revise.
